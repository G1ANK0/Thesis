Okay, let's map out a comprehensive roadmap for your entire thesis project, starting from 
today. This plan integrates your milestones and provides actionable steps for each phase. 
Assume a potential timeline of roughly 6 months (adjust based on your actual deadline and credits).

Guiding Principles:
    - Iterative Progress: Build, test, and refine continuously.
    - Documentation is Key: Write notes, summaries, and documentation as you go, not just  
      at the end. This forms the basis of your thesis document.
    - Supervisor Communication: Schedule regular (e.g., bi-weekly) meetings with your   
      supervisor to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.
    - Version Control: Use Git from Day 1 for all code and potentially your thesis draft   
      (using Markdown or LaTeX).
    - Task Management: Use a simple tool (like Trello, a spreadsheet, or even a text file) 
      to track tasks within each phase.


Phase 0: Setup & Kick-off (Week 1):

    - Goal: Establish foundations for project management, research, and initial 
            understanding.
    - Tasks:
        1) Clarify Requirements: Reread the Thesis mail.txt. Note any immediate questions 
                                 for your supervisor.
        2) Set up Project Management:
            - Create a dedicated project folder.
            - Initialize a Git repository (git init). Make initial commit.
            - Choose and set up a task management system.
            - Set up a system for notes/research (e.g., Zotero for references, Obsidian/
              Notion/Word for notes).
        3) Initial Supervisor Meeting: Discuss the plan, scope, any immediate questions, 
                                       preferred communication style, and meeting          
                                       frequency. Confirm technology stack 
           expectations (Python/Java, JS, MySQL).
        4) Preliminary Reading: Start broad reading on asymmetric crypto concepts (RSA/ECC 
                                basics), the idea of client-side encryption in web apps, 
                                and core GDPR principles related to data security. Don't   
                                go too deep yet.

    - Output: Project structure set up, initial notes, confirmed plan with supervisor.


Phase 1: Preliminary Study & Research (Weeks 1-4) - Milestone 1 Focus:

    - Goal: Gain deep theoretical understanding of cryptography, relevant technologies, 
            and legal context.

    - Tasks:
        1) Deep Dive: Asymmetric Cryptography:
            - Study RSA and ECC algorithms, padding schemes (OAEP), key sizes, pros/cons.
            - Research digital signatures (may be relevant later, even if not primary   
                focus).
            - Sources: Crypto textbooks, NIST publications, academic papers, reliable   
                       online tutorials.
        2) Deep Dive: Web Cryptography API:
            - Thoroughly read MDN documentation: SubtleCrypto methods (generateKey,        
                importKey, exportKey, encrypt, decrypt).
            - Understand key formats (SPKI, PKCS#8, JWK) and the extractable flag 
              implications.
            - Look for examples and limitations.
        3) Deep Dive: Server-Side Technologies:
            - Review chosen backend language's crypto libraries (Python cryptography or 
                Java JCE/Bouncy Castle). How do they handle keys?
            - Review basics of chosen web framework (Flask/Django or Spring).
            - Review basic MySQL interactions (connecting, schema design).
        4) Deep Dive: Key Management:
            - Research best practices for client-side private key storage (this is 
                CRITICAL and HARD). Explore password-based key derivation (PBKDF2), secure 
                storage options (IndexedDB vs localStorage, OS-level storage?), non-
                extractable keys. Understand the security vs. usability trade-offs.
            - Sources: NIST SP 800-57, OWASP Key Management Cheat Sheet, security blogs/
                articles.
        5) Deep Dive: GDPR & Data Protection:
            - Identify specific GDPR articles relevant to data security (Art. 32), 
                encryption, controller/processor roles.
            - Understand the definition of "sensitive data" and requirements for its 
                protection.
            - Sources: Official GDPR text, guidance from Data Protection Authorities.
        6) Synthesize & Write: Start drafting the theoretical background sections of your 
             thesis. Compile findings into the Milestone 1 Report.

    - Output: Milestone 1: Relazione teorica su crittografia asimmetrica e normative di 
                protezione dei dati. (Solid understanding documented).


Phase 2: System Design (Weeks 5-7) - Milestone 2 Focus: 

    - Goal: Define the detailed architecture and data flow of your system.

    - Tasks:
        1) Finalize Technology Choices: Confirm specific libraries (e.g., Flask, 
             cryptography lib, specific JS frameworks if any).
        2) Define Crypto Specifications: Choose specific algorithms (e.g., RSA-OAEP 4096-  
             bit, SHA-256 hash). Justify choices based on research.
        3) Design System Architecture: Draw diagrams showing Browser <-> Web Server <-> 
             Database interactions. Identify components.
        4) Map Data Flows: Create sequence diagrams for key user actions:
            - Registration (key gen, public key storage)
            - Login (loading/unlocking private key)
            - Data Submission (encryption, transmission, server storage)
            - Data Retrieval (server retrieval, transmission, decryption)
        5) API Specification: Define RESTful API endpoints on the server (URLs, methods, 
             expected JSON request/response formats).
        6) Database Schema Design: Define table structures (Users, SensitiveData) with 
             precise column names and data types (e.g., VARCHAR for username, TEXT or BLOB 
             for public key, BLOB for encrypted data).
        7) Define Private Key Handling Strategy: Commit to a specific client-side storage 
             mechanism based on Phase 1 research (e.g., password-derived key encrypting an 
             extractable private key stored in IndexedDB). Document the chosen process and 
             its rationale/risks.
        8) Outline Security Measures: List security considerations beyond core crypto 
             (HTTPS, authentication, input validation, basic server hardening).
        9) Write Design Documentation: Compile all the above into the Milestone 2   
             document.

    - Output: Milestone 2: Documentazione di progettazione architetturale e flusso dei     
                           dati nel sistema.

Phase 3: Prototype Implementation (Weeks 8-14) - Milestone 3 Focus

    - Goal: Build a functional prototype based on the design specification.

    - Tasks: (Follow the detailed implementation roadmap provided previously)
        1) Setup Development Environment: Project structure, database, install 
           dependencies.
        2) Implement Server Backend: Basic Flask/Java app, database models, user 
             registration (storing public key), API endpoints for data storage/retrieval   
             (initially without authentication).
        3) Implement Client Frontend: Basic HTML pages (register, main app view).
        4) Implement Client Crypto Logic (JS/Web Crypto API):
            - Key pair generation.
            - Key import/export.
            - Encryption function.
            - Decryption function.
        5) Integrate Registration Flow: Client generates keys, sends public key to server 
             during registration.
        6) Implement Client Key Management: Implement the chosen strategy for storing/
             retrieving/unlocking the private key.
        7) Implement Core Data Flow:
            - Client encrypts data using public key, sends to server.
            - Server stores encrypted data.
            - Client requests data, server sends encrypted data.
            - Client decrypts data using private key, displays it.
        8) Add Basic Authentication: Implement simple login/session management on the 
             server to protect endpoints.
        9) Iterative Testing & Debugging: Test each component as you build it. Use browser 
             developer tools extensively.

    - Output: Milestone 3: Prototipo funzionante con crittografia dei dati sensibili e 
                           gestione delle chiavi. (Codebase on Git).


Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Weeks 15-17) - Milestone 4 Focus

    - Goal: Systematically test the prototype for functionality, security, and 
            performance.

    - Tasks:
        1) Develop Test Plan: Outline specific test cases for functionality, security, and 
             performance.
        2) Functional Testing: Verify all features work as designed (registration, 
             encryption, storage, retrieval, decryption) with various inputs (different 
             users, data types).
        3) Security Testing:
            - Attempt to access data without authorization.
            - Inspect browser storage - how protected is the private key? (Document 
                weaknesses honestly).
            - Check for basic web vulnerabilities (e.g., input validation on server).
            - Does HTTPS work correctly (if configured)?
        4) Performance Testing:
            - Measure time for key generation.
            - Measure time for encryption/decryption (client-side).
            - Assess overall responsiveness â€“ is the crypto overhead noticeable?
        5) Usability Assessment: Is the key handling process understandable for a user?
        6) Analyze & Document Results: Record all test outcomes, identify bugs, 
             vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks.
        7) Refine Prototype (Optional): Fix critical bugs found during testing if time 
             permits.
        8) Write Test Report: Summarize the testing process, results, and analysis.

    - Output: Milestone 4: Report di test, validazione della sicurezza e performance del 
                           sistema.
